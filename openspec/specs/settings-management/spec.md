## Purpose

User preferences persistence and settings UI.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Store user preferences in UserDefaults
The system SHALL persist user preferences (default source language, default target language, default translation engine, concurrent translation limit, OpenAI base URL, OpenAI model name) using UserDefaults.

#### Scenario: Preferences persist across launches
- **WHEN** user sets default language pair to Japanese → Traditional Chinese and quits the app
- **THEN** the app launches with Japanese → Traditional Chinese pre-selected

#### Scenario: OpenAI base URL persists across launches
- **WHEN** user sets the OpenAI base URL to `https://custom-api.example.com/v1` and quits the app
- **THEN** the app launches with the custom base URL pre-filled

### Requirement: Store API keys in Keychain
The system SHALL store translation service API keys (DeepL, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic) in the macOS Keychain using the Security framework. Keys SHALL be stored per-service with the app's bundle ID as the service identifier.

#### Scenario: Save API key
- **WHEN** user enters their DeepL API key in settings
- **THEN** the key is stored in Keychain and persists across app launches

#### Scenario: Retrieve API key
- **WHEN** user initiates a DeepL translation
- **THEN** the system retrieves the DeepL API key from Keychain

### Requirement: Settings UI
The system SHALL provide a settings view (accessible via Cmd+,) where users can configure API keys, default language pair, default translation engine, and update preferences. The Preferences tab SHALL include an "Updates" section with a toggle for automatic update checking and a "Check for Updates Now" button. The OpenAI section SHALL be renamed to "OpenAI Compatible" and SHALL include a Base URL text field, a free-text Model field, and "Reset to Default" buttons for both fields.

#### Scenario: Open settings
- **WHEN** user presses Cmd+,
- **THEN** the settings window opens showing API key fields, default preferences, and update preferences

#### Scenario: Toggle automatic updates
- **WHEN** user toggles the automatic update check setting
- **THEN** the preference is persisted and Sparkle respects the new setting on next launch

#### Scenario: Manual update check from settings
- **WHEN** user clicks "Check for Updates Now" in the Preferences tab
- **THEN** Sparkle performs an update check and displays the result

#### Scenario: OpenAI Compatible section layout
- **WHEN** user views the API Keys tab
- **THEN** the section header SHALL display "OpenAI Compatible" with a brain icon
- **AND** the section SHALL contain an API Key secure field, a Base URL text field with a "Reset to Default" button, and a Model text field with a "Reset to Default" button

### Requirement: Validate API key presence before translation
The system SHALL check that the required API key exists before attempting translation. If the key is missing, the system SHALL prompt the user to enter it in settings.

#### Scenario: Missing API key
- **WHEN** user selects Claude engine but has not entered an Anthropic API key
- **THEN** the system shows an alert directing the user to settings to enter the key
